# bashscripts
Bashscripts written for data analysis from the data generated in NEWTON-X format(which has interface to COLUMBUS, GAUSSIAN, BAGEL, TURBOMOLE and a lot of other computational chemistry packages).


These scripts are written for my own purposes. So, modify it accordingly if you are using it. Also, they can be improved substantially in some cases and I am currently working on that. I will try to make the scripts more intelligible in the future. You are welcomed to suggest improvements.
